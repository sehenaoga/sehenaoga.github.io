> #### Hola! Hi! Ciao! 
> I'm an aspiring PhD student and this is my little corner on the internet to post cool images about my research. I'm currently finishing my Master's degree at the University of Pittsburgh, where I study the intersection between Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science through the solution of complex fluid flow problems using high-performance computing resources. Welcome aboard!

# Bio

 I'm a Mechanical Engineer with a vast understanding of Scientific Computing applied to Fluid Mechanics problems in the fields of Wind Turbine Aerodynamics and Atmospheric Flows. I'm a highly-motivated professional interested in leveraging Data-driven Physics and High-performance Computing to advance in human understanding of the nature of fluid motion. [\[CV\]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xo3hGSOiF1TlF06tmNUMxDqxj7R4HhDQ/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}

## Interests

*   **Data-driven physics:** Deducing cool equations and making predictions from observations of the nature of the world
*   **Fluid motion:** Describing the characteristics of fluids moving under many conditions and scales
*   **Computer simulations:** Using computers to make accurate predictictions about the behavior of nature
*   **Sustainability:** Leveraging all the tools above for preserving nature

# Research

## [Oscillations in Katabatic Flows](./katabatic.html)

 Katabatic means descending in Greek and when combined with the word Flow it means _air flowing down a slope and moving in funny ways that are not yet fully understood_. Currently, there is a major interest in understanding the oscillations the airflow describes along its way. [Click here to find out more](./katabatic.html). 


## [Wind Turbine Aerodynamic Simulations](./wind_turbines.html)

 Do you think we can propose new designs that are more efficient than the [standard three-bladed wind turbine model](https://flic.kr/p/aa1uWJ){:target="_blank"}? Well, I've been intrigued by that question lately and [here's what I've learned so far](./wind_turbines.html) while using computers to predict the aerodynamic performance of alternative wind turbine designs.
