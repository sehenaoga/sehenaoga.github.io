# Bio

 I am a computational scientist interested in exploring the connecting threads among applied mathematics, computer simulations, and engineering applications. My ultimate goal is to contribute to advancing our understanding of nature through scientific computing. Currently, I am working on exploring applications for digital twins in space, and in the past, I have used computational fluid dynamics to study atmospheric flows and wind turbine aerodynamics. You can find my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VKT_visrti4Hd8m5nOLNiKYmU601JtfO/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} here, and please reach out if you want to collaborate! 

## Interests

*   **Uncertainty quantification:** Integrating the probabilistic nature of life into the scientific and engineering systems we know so well. 
*   **Reduced order modeling:** Building simplified models to represent nature that are both accurate and fast to evaluate.
*   **Digital Twins:** Incorporate digital replicas of physical systems into the decision-making loop aiming to bring the system to an optimal state through the continuous integration of data and models. 
*   **Sustainability:** Leveraging all the tools above for a sustainable use of nature on this earth and beyond.

# Research

## Digital Twins for Space Systems
 We seek to build build digital twins of systems that live in space through a formal mathematical representation of the relationship between the digital twin and its corresponding physical asset. The overall goal is for the digital twin to inform decisions that realize value in the space system, such as maximizing mission success, minimizing fuel consumption, and maximizing maneuvering precision.

## Oscillations in Katabatic Flows

 Katabatic means descending in Greek and when combined with the word Flow it means _air flowing down a slope and moving in funny ways that are not yet fully understood_. Currently, there is a major interest in understanding the oscillations the airflow describes along its way. [Click here to find out more](./katabatic.html). 


## Wind Turbine Aerodynamic Simulations

 Do you think we can propose new designs that are more efficient than the [standard three-bladed wind turbine model](https://flic.kr/p/aa1uWJ){:target="_blank"}? Well, I've been intrigued by that question lately and [here's what I've learned so far](./wind_turbines.html) while using computers to predict the aerodynamic performance of alternative wind turbine designs.
